# Implementing_algorithms_in-_C
This repository contains a collection of algorithms and implementations focusing on various search and optimization techniques in artificial intelligence. The implementations are primarily done in C and cover a range of algorithms that are fundamental to problem-solving and decision-making processes.

CIA1 - Search Algorithms
AOStar.c

Description: Implementation of the AO* algorithm, used for searching through an AND-OR graph, useful in problem-solving scenarios involving contingent decisions.
Key Features:
Solves complex decision-making problems.
Explores both AND and OR nodes.
AStar.c

Description: Implements the A* algorithm, a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in finding the shortest path.
Key Features:
Uses both cost and heuristic (f(n) = g(n) + h(n)).
Guarantees the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible.
BranchAndBoundCostHeuristic.c

Description: Implementation of the Branch and Bound algorithm that uses cost and heuristic values to prune the search space.
Key Features:
Combines cost and heuristic for efficient pruning.
BranchAndBoundDeadHorsePrinciple.c

Description: An extended Branch and Bound method that incorporates the Dead Horse Principle, where unpromising paths are pruned early.
Key Features:
Early pruning of non-viable paths.
BeamSearch.c

Description: Implements the Beam Search algorithm, a heuristic search technique that explores a set number of the most promising nodes at each level.
Key Features:
Uses a beam width to limit the search space.
Efficient memory usage compared to exhaustive search methods.
BestFirstSearch.c

Description: Implements the Best-First Search algorithm, which greedily selects the most promising node based on a given heuristic.
Key Features:
Uses a priority queue to explore the best node first.
BreadthFirstSearch.c

Description: Implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm, a fundamental graph traversal technique that explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
Key Features:
Guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
Explores neighbors level by level.
Suitable for tree and graph traversal problems.
BMS.c

Description: Implements a variant of Beam Search with specific beam width, focusing on heuristic-driven exploration.
Key Features:
Efficient search within the constraints of a limited beam width.
BranchAndBound.c

Description: Standard implementation of the Branch and Bound algorithm, which systematically explores all possible solutions and prunes suboptimal paths.
Key Features:
Guarantees finding the optimal solution.
Prunes non-promising paths to save time.
DepthFirstSearch.c

Description: A basic implementation of Depth-First Search, a fundamental graph traversal algorithm.
Key Features:
Explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.
HillClimbing.c

Description: Implementation of the Hill Climbing algorithm, a local search technique that iteratively improves the solution by selecting the neighbor with the highest value.
Key Features:
Can get stuck in local optima.
Suitable for optimization problems.
Oracle.c

Description: A simple oracle-finding algorithm that attempts to find the best solution in a decision problem.
Key Features:
Explores the search space to find an optimal oracle.
CIA2 - Gaming Adversarial Algorithms
AlphaBetaPruning.c

CIA2 - Gaming Adversarial Algorithm
Description: Implementation of the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated.
Key Features:
Prunes branches in the game tree that donâ€™t influence the final decision.
More efficient than standard Minimax.
Minimax.c

Description: Implementation of the Minimax algorithm, which provides an optimal move for the player assuming the opponent plays optimally.
Key Features:
Evaluates all possible moves to find the best outcome.
